You're updating a nearly complete, beautifully designed website for the company Moderniza.pt. This site is in Portuguese (PT-PT) by default and must preserve the visual identity (dark theme with neon green and blue). You're now required to make functional and design improvements while maintaining the modern and elegant style.

🔁 General instructions:
- All current site content must remain in Portuguese (Portugal), with correct grammar and vocabulary.
- Perform a full sweep to test all interactive elements (navigation, buttons, carousels, links, hover effects, etc.).
- Ensure responsiveness on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

🧩 Form Integration:
- The contact form already exists on the site. DO NOT replace it with the HubSpot embed code.
- Instead, when the user submits the form, send the data via **HubSpot Forms API** (hidden backend integration). Use the portal ID and form ID from this embed snippet:

```html
<script src="https://js-eu1.hsforms.net/forms/embed/146428330.js" defer></script>
<div class="hs-form-frame" data-region="eu1" data-form-id="c9a2bd57-28a9-41e6-b555-41f30448dfda" data-portal-id="146428330"></div>
````

* The form must keep all existing fields (name, email, phone, company, message) and also support **file uploads** (jpeg, PDF, docx).
* Show a beautiful confirmation modal or toast when the form is successfully sent.

🌍 Language switcher:

* Add a **language selector** in the top-right corner of the site.
* Supported languages: **Portuguese (default), English, Spanish, French**
* Use flag icons or a minimal dropdown. All language content must remain consistent with the PT version.

🌞 Light/Dark Mode:

* Currently only dark mode exists. Add a full **light mode theme**.
* Insert a **toggle button** (sun/moon icon) in the top navigation, styled discreetly.
* Save the user's mode preference (via localStorage or cookies).

📍 Contact Details:

* Update company address to:
  **Av. Sá da Bandeira N. 33 L 409, 3000-351 Coimbra, Portugal**
* Update the phone number to:
  **+351 937 059 712**
* Make both the address and phone clickable (Google Maps and tel: link).

📷 Design Fixes:

* The "Quem Somos" section image must be replaced with a high-quality, visually aligned image with the site's aesthetic.
* In the section "As Nossas Soluções", you show 5 service cards in a grid. Currently, 2 at the bottom are misaligned. Fix by:

  * Either centering them horizontally
  * Or adding a **sixth card** (suggested content: "Consultoria Digital")

📱 Carousel Fix:

* In the "Templates" carousel, a **white scrollbar is visible** — this breaks the visual harmony.
* Replace it with a custom styled scrollbar or hide it entirely using modern CSS.

🛑 Footer:

* Two links are present: "Termos de Serviço" and "Política de Privacidade", but they open nowhere.
* Implement modern modals (popup overlays) that open when clicked, using the same color scheme and clean design.
* Add a **working Instagram icon and link** to:
  [https://www.instagram.com/moderniza.pt](https://www.instagram.com/moderniza.pt)

🌟 Reviews Section:

* Add a new section near the bottom of the page titled **"Avaliações de Clientes"**.
* This section should include a visually stunning **carousel** with testimonials, profile images, and stars.
* Each slide can show 1–2 reviews with smooth transitions and modern typography.

📦 Optional (if needed):

* Use Supabase as a fallback backend only if HubSpot integration fails (but prioritize HubSpot).
* If using Supabase for storage, store lead form data and uploaded files with basic security.

Final step:

* Test the entire website and ensure all animations, form submissions, language toggles, and scroll behaviors work correctly.
* The site must remain fast, accessible, and aligned with top-tier UI/UX practices.
