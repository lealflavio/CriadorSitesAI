You're finalizing the Moderniza.pt website. It's already highly polished, but some targeted corrections are needed to reach full professional quality. Please apply the following updates precisely.

==================================================
üé® 1. Light Mode Improvements (High Priority)
==================================================
The current light mode is too flat and lacks visibility.

- Increase contrast between text and background elements.
- Fix all **text visibility issues**: ensure no white or light text over light backgrounds.
- Apply subtle shadows or borders to buttons, cards, containers for depth.
- Use a slightly off-white background color (avoid pure white).
- Maintain the existing typographic style ‚Äî only adjust for readability.

Review:
- Headers, body text, buttons
- Cards in "Solu√ß√µes", "Pre√ßos", "Testemunhos"
- Forms and input placeholders

==================================================
üì± 2. Mobile Responsiveness (Critical)
==================================================
- Fix layout breakage in the **hero section**, where the title overflows on small screens.
- Use responsive font scaling and paddings.
- Ensure the entire mobile layout works smoothly across:
  - 320px, 375px, 414px, 768px breakpoints

Perform full mobile QA:
- No horizontal scrollbars
- Proper stacking of sections and elements
- Responsive navigation

==================================================
üîó 3. Social Links
==================================================
- Remove the **LinkedIn** icon from the footer or any other part of the site.
- Keep only relevant social icons:
  - Instagram ‚Üí https://www.instagram.com/moderniza.pt

Ensure icons are styled consistently with the visual identity (hover color, padding, spacing).

==================================================
ü§ñ 4. ‚ÄúIAs em A√ß√£o‚Äù Section (Responsive Tab Fix)
==================================================
- Fix the buttons (tabs) that currently overlap or break layout when resizing.
- Implement responsive wrapping with `flex-wrap` or CSS grid.
- Maintain proper padding and spacing between buttons at all screen sizes.
- Ensure tab functionality continues to work correctly after the layout fix.

==================================================
üåü 5. Testimonials Carousel
==================================================
- Optimize the layout so that:
  - On desktop: show **3 testimonials** per view
  - On tablet: show **2**
  - On mobile: show **1**

- Use compact cards with name, photo, stars, and short review.
- Ensure horizontal scrolling or swiping is smooth.
- Eliminate any visible white scrollbar.
- Maintain spacing and aesthetic balance.

==================================================
‚ùå 6. REMOVE Language Selector
==================================================
- The language selector is not functioning and should be removed entirely from the website.
- Eliminate both visual elements and underlying logic (JavaScript/state).
- All content will remain in **Portuguese (Portugal)** only.
- Do not display any dropdowns or buttons referring to other languages.

==================================================
üß™ 7. Final Quality Pass
==================================================
Once the changes are complete, do a thorough full-site test:

- ‚úÖ All text is readable and well-aligned in both light and dark modes
- ‚úÖ All sections work responsively across desktop, tablet, and mobile
- ‚úÖ No layout overlaps, overflows, or console errors
- ‚úÖ All buttons, forms, tabs, carousels function as expected
- ‚úÖ Design is visually consistent and clean
- ‚úÖ Site loads fast and feels modern

The final result must be a **bug-free, fully responsive, beautiful website in Portuguese (PT-PT)**.
